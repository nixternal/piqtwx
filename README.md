# piqtwx
Raspberry Pi Weather Station/Clock - Built on Weather Underground &amp; the Qt GUI-application framework

Nothing to see down here, maybe one of these days, but this was just a first run
project with my Pi 3 & PiTFT.

Left the Qt Creator project files (the .pro, .h, and .cpp files in src/) in case
you feel like using Qt Creator and tweaking it. I just used to rapidly prototype
this project. Next iteration of this project might use Kivy instead.
